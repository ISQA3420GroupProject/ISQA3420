#Executive Summary

Problem: 
By participating with open source communities, numerous organizations seek for talented developers to quickly improve and enhance the assets for their project. They bring external assets (code) into the organization, and doing so the bring risk into the organization. Some years ago we can advise to buy before you build, but with the rise of open source software whish give a free access to a number of software, which bring a risk of licenses and vulnerabilities into the organization and it is important for the organization to address those risk as we can advise download and evaluate before use


Solution:  We are designing a system using the management principles to allow our corporate developers and corporate managers to communicate and decide on which open source software they believe is best based on all the information found using our system.
