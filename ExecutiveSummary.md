#Executive Summary

Problem: 
By participating with open source communities, numerous organizations seek for talented developers to quickly improve and enhance the assets for their project. They bring external assets (code) into the organization, and doing so the bring risk into the organization. Some years ago we can advise to buy before you build, but with the rise of open source software whish give a free access to a number of software, the risk of licenses and vulnerabilities on those free software became relevante into the organization and it is important for the organization to address them, as we can advise download and evaluate before use


Solution:  
As a solution to the risck we are designing a system using the management principles to enablecorporate developers to check-in communal and supply chain assets, corporate Project managers to project managers to see the risk criteria associated with software projects, project manager to create and assign policy to software projects, alerting relevant people when thresholds are not reached, and the systeme will alert developers/managers of license obligations that need to be addressed when a software project is approved.
